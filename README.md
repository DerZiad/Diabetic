# Classification of diabetic patients
In the context of my 5th semester in Morocco, the university proposed an artificial intelligence project to us, aimed at assisting us in the field. The project involves creating machine learning and deep learning models to classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic, and making decisions to select the best model among several options.
# Functionalities
To use this application professionally, they have requested that we deploy the executable version of the application which can take data manually or via an Excel file, and process the data to predict whether one or more patients are diabetic. In this application, the prediction is made by two models that have achieved higher accuracy and avoided significant overfitting.
# Models
- Machine Learning :
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Logistic Regression
    - KNN Classifier
- Deep Learning

# Optimisation
For proper optimization, we had to scale the data and use K-fold cross-validation techniques.

# Data Visualization

We can notice here that the RandomForest and the DeepLearning are making the best approximation
